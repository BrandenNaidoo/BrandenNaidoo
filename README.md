## Software & Security Architect | Infrastructure Forensics | SME

I am a Software and Security Architect focused on Zero-Trust infrastructure and hardened system design. I designed and built Companion Sentinel, an XDR forensic engine that utilizes behavioral auditing to protect production environments. My work combines full-stack development with deep-system security to enable stealth deployments and proactive threat detection.

### Engineering Achievements
*   Companion Sentinel Platform: Architected a multi-platform XDR suite featuring origin stealth and secure infrastructure isolation.
*   System Hardening: 12-phase security lifecycle for production-grade environments.
*   Software Architecture: Specialist in building high-performance, secure applications using Next.js, Go, and resilient backend systems.
*   Forensic Engineering: Developed automated response logic and real-time system audit tools.

### Forensic Methodology
I focus on behavioral auditing rather than relying solely on static signatures. By monitoring system-level changes and execution patterns, I establish visibility into layers that traditional perimeter security often overlooks.
